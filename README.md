# House_price_prediction

Let us build a neural network that predicts the price of a house according to a simple formula.
House pricing is as follows :
50000 for house and 50000 extra for each bedroom.
Now 1 bedroom house costs 100000 and 2 bed room house costs 150000 etc.
Let us create a neural network that learns this relationship so that it would predict a 7 bedroom house as costing close to 400000 etc.

Your network might work better if you scale the house price down. You do not have to give the answer 400.
It might be better to create something that predicts the number 4, and then your answer is in the 'hundreds of thousands' etc.
